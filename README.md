# Quicklinks
A webpage I use as my default homepage in browsers and anywhere else you can set a default landing page

# Roadmap
Okay, "roadmap" is a strong word, but I have Big Dreamsâ„¢ of adding:

- Sidebar installation instructions for browsers that support sidebars;
- A dynamic new/same tab checkbox (a la <a href="https://techmeme.com">Techmeme</a>); and
- An integrated way to customize the links.

But Quicklinks is mostly for me, so it comes without promises. Most people who can code up something like this can do it far better than I can, and most who can't will still be able to name two or three ways of doing the same thing without writing a single line of HTML. 

That's fine. You, as the kids say, do you. 

And feel free to <a href="https://github.com/joeross/Quicklinks/fork">fork it</a>.
